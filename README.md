### The G Key is Pressed

1. **Key Event Handling**: When the "g" key is pressed, the operating system captures the key event and sends it to the active application, which is the web browser in this case.

2. **Input Handling by Browser**: The browser processes this key event and checks if there are any active input fields. If there is an active input field, the character "g" is added to the field.

3. **Address Bar Interaction**: If the address bar is active, the browser might suggest URLs based on history or bookmarks starting with "g".

4. **Network Request Initiation**: If "google.com" is typed and Enter is pressed, the browser initiates a DNS lookup to resolve the domain name to an IP address.

5. **TCP/IP Connection**: The browser establishes a TCP connection to the resolved IP address.

6. **HTTPS Request**: The browser sends an HTTPS GET request to the server.

7. **Server Response**: The server responds with the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript needed to render the Google homepage.

8. **Rendering**: The browser parses the HTML, applies the CSS, and executes JavaScript to render the page.
